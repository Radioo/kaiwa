# Setting up for development in IntelliJ IDEA

## Backend
1. Clone the project
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. If the IDE does not set up a configuration by default, create a new configuration for a Spring Boot application (the main class is `com.example.chat.ChatApplication`)
4. You should be able to run the application now

## Frontend
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Install `yarn` globally: `npm install -g yarn`
3. Run `yarn install` in the root directory of the project
4. You can now use `yarn watch` to compile the frontend code and watch for changes
